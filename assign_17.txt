#1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of cnum and snum are 
#different from one another, and so that NULL values are excluded from the date field. 

create table orders1 
(
	onum int(4) unique key,
    amt float(7,2),
    cnum int(4) ,
    snum int(4) ,
    odate  date not null,
    primary key(Cnum,Snum)
);



#2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted, 
#snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically between A and M, inclusive 
#(assume all names will be uppercase).

create table salespeople1 
(
		comm float (7,2) default 10 not null,
		snum int (4) primary key,
        sname varchar (25) check (substr(sname,1,1) between 'A' and 'M')
);
desc salespeople1;

#3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, 
#and the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields. 
Create table orders2
(
onum int(4),
cnum int(4),
snum int(4),
check (onum>cnum and cnum>snum)
);
